    <h3>What is Social Butterfly?</h3>
    <p>
        Social Butterfly allows you to anonymously chat with random strangers
        through <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/">Google Talk</a>.  If you
        use Gmail, you already have Google Talk.
    </p>

    <h3>Open Source</h3>
    <p>
        Social Butterfly is written in Python for Google&rsquo;s App Engine
        cloud.  You can view Social Butterfly&rsquo;s clean, object-oriented
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/social-butterfly/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk">source code</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Scalable</h3>
    <p>
        Social Butterfly uses techniques like memcache,
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/social-butterfly/source/browse/trunk/shards.py">sharding counters</a>,
        and deferred task queues to scale to
        <span class="num_users">{{ stats.num_users }}</span> users and
        counting.
    </p>

    <h3>Real-Time</h3>
    <p>
        Social Butterfly uses
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/social-butterfly/source/browse/trunk/channels.py">channels</a>
        (similar to WebSockets) for real-time communication.  The footer on
        every page is live yet scalable.
    </p>
