    <h3>What is Social Butterfly?</h3>
    <p>
        Social Butterfly allows you to anonymously chat with strangers through
        <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/">Google Talk</a>.  If you use
        Gmail, you already have Google Talk.
    </p>

    <div class="sign_up">
        <h3>How do I sign up?</h3>
        <form class="register" action="/" method="post" autocomplete="off">
            <div>
                <input type="text" name="handle"
                       value="Enter your Google Talk address here." />
            </div>
        </form>
    </div>

    <div class="signed_up">
        <h3>You&rsquo;ve successfully signed up.</h3>
        <p>
            Social Butterfly has sent you a chat invitation.  Please accept the
            invitation, then Social Butterfly will add itself to your buddy
            list.
        </p>

        <h3>What&rsquo;s next?</h3>
        <p>
            Once Social Butterfly is on your buddy list, send it a message with
            only the text &ldquo;/help&rdquo; (without the quotes).  Chat with
            strangers!
        </p>
    </div>
