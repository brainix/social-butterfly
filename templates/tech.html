        <h1>We love technology.</h1>
        <p>
            Social Butterfly allows you to chat with strangers over
            <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/">Google Talk</a>.
            This page describes the technologies we use to make Social
            Butterfly.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h1>Cloud, Open Source</h1>
        <p>
            Social Butterfly is written in Python for Google&rsquo;s App Engine
            cloud.  You can view Social Butterfly&rsquo;s clean,
            object-oriented
            <a href="http://code.google.com/p/social-butterfly/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk">source code</a>.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>Scalable</h1>
        <p>
            We use techniques like memcache,
            <a href="http://code.google.com/p/social-butterfly/source/browse/trunk/shards.py">sharding counters</a>,
            and deferred task queues to scale Social Butterfly up to
            <span class="num_users">{{ stats.num_users }}</span>
            users and counting.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>Real-Time</h1>
        <p>
            We use
            <a href="http://code.google.com/p/social-butterfly/source/browse/trunk/channels.py">channels</a>
            (similar to Comet or WebSockets) for real-time communication.  The
            <a href="http://code.google.com/p/social-butterfly/source/browse/trunk/assets/script.js">footer and Growls</a>
            on every page are live.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h1>Standards Conformant</h1>
        <p>
            We care about the Internet, which means that we care about web
            standards.  We write valid
            <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fsocial-butterfly.appspot.com%2F">HTML</a>,
            <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fsocial-butterfly.appspot.com%2Fassets%2Fstyle.css&profile=css3&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en">CSS</a>,
            and JavaScript.
