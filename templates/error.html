                Once upon a midnight dreary, while I websurfed weak and weary,<br />
                Over many a strange and spurious website of &lsquo;hot chicks galore,&rsquo;<br />
                While I clicked my fav&rsquo;rite bookmark, suddenly there came a warning,<br />
                And my heart was filled with mourning, mourning for my dear amour.<br />
                &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis not possible,&rdquo; I muttered, &ldquo;give me back my cheap hardcore!&rdquo;
            </p>
            <p>Quoth the server, &ldquo;<b>404</b>.&rdquo;
