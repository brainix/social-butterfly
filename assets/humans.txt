The Noun Project

    The Noun Project collects, organizes and adds to the highly recognizable
    symbols that form the world's visual language, so they may share them in a
    fun and meaningful way.  Various artists within The Noun Project made the
    Social Butterfly favicon.ico as well as the images that you see on the
    Sticky (Growl-style) notifications.
